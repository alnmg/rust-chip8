# rust CHIP8 emulator

yeah, i made another chip 8 emulator.. but now in rust


it passes the inpotants test (https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite) (but the cursor dont work, so you need to add the values in memory directly into the code)

fell fre to use the code if you want.. but its a very bad code :P
